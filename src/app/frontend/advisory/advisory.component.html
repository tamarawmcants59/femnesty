          	<h3>Dr Catherine Baudino, PhD, MNCP, FRSA</h3>
          	<p>Catherine Baudino had a long, high-flying career in publishing, finance, telecommunications and solar energy before pursuing her current path as coach and mentor to both corporate and individual clients. Catherine became the UK’s youngest PhD at the age of 23 and in 1987 she cracked the ‘glass ceiling’ when she appeared on BBC2’s The Money Programme in a series that brought ‘reality TV’ into our homes and was a clear precursor of The Apprentice. The end of the series saw Catherine hired by media mogul Robert Maxwell. Subsequent roles included CEO of Maxwell Satellite Communications and becoming the first European Business Director of the NASDAQ Stock Market.</p>
